### About AWQ

AWQ is an efficient, accurate and blazing-fast low-bit weight quantization method, currently supporting 4-bit quantization. Compared to GPTQ, it offers faster Transformers-based inference with equivalent or better quality compared to the most commonly used GPTQ settings.

AWQ models are currently supported on Linux and Windows, with NVidia GPUs only. macOS users: please use GGUF models instead.

It is supported by:

- [Text Generation Webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) - using Loader: AutoAWQ
- [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) - version 0.2.2 or later for support for all model types.
- [Hugging Face Text Generation Inference (TGI)](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference)
- [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers) version 4.35.0 and later, from any code or client that supports Transformers
- [AutoAWQ](https://github.com/casper-hansen/AutoAWQ) - for use from Python code

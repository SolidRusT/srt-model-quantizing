# Quant-AWQ Application

The Quant-AWQ Application automates the quantization of models using the Adaptive Weight Quantization (AWQ) method, providing efficient and fast lower-bit model representations suitable for production environments.

## Features

- **Automated Model Quantization**: Automates the conversion of models to use lower-bit representations with a focus on AWQ techniques.
- **Support for Multiple Model Formats**: Handles models in PyTorch format and converts them to `safetensors` for compatibility with different deployment scenarios.
- **Template-based Documentation Management**: Automatically updates README files using predefined templates to reflect model processing stages and ensure accurate documentation.
- **Robust Logging and Error Handling**: Offers comprehensive logging and error handling for traceability and troubleshooting throughout the quantization process.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:
- Python version 3.8 or newer
- Required Python packages installed from the provided requirements file

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the source code to your local machine using the following commands:

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.com/quant-awq.git
   cd quant-awq
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the application, execute the main script with the required parameters:

```bash
python app/main.py --author [author] --model [model]
```

Replace `[author]` and `[model]` with the actual author and model name you wish to quantize.

## Configuration

Modify the settings in `app/config.py` to adjust paths, quantization parameters, and other operational settings as needed.

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Contains the main application code.
  - `config.py`: Configuration settings for the application.
  - `converter.py`: Manages the conversion of models from PyTorch to `safetensors`.
  - `main.py`: Entry point of the application.
  - `model_utils.py`: Utilities for managing model downloads and preprocessing.
  - `quantization.py`: Core logic for model quantization.
  - `template_parser.py`: Handles the updating of README files from templates.
- `data/`: Directory for storing model data and outputs.
- `logs/`: Contains log files generated by the application.
- `repos/`: Stores configuration files and scripts used in the quantization process.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the application's functionality.

## Testing

Run the unit tests to verify that all components of the application are functioning correctly:

```bash
python run_tests.py
```

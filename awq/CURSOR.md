# Development Notes

See the [.cursorrules](.cursorrules) file for the system prompt.

## Start a composer sprint

This is a good starting point to begin a development cycle.

```plaintext
My @Codebase is updated. Let's begin the next development cycle for our quantization pipeline app. Start by reviewing the repository structure, identifying any dead or duplicate code, and addressing incomplete sections. Check for any missing or outdated documentation, ensuring that the README.md and other instructional materials are up-to-date. Use our ROADMAP.md file to track progress, priorities, and any adjustments needed across this cycle. Propose a prioritized list of actions to enhance the quality and maintainability of the codebase, while ensuring that all changes are reflected in the alignment file.

## Let's Proceed

If the AI starts just blabbing and not doing anything, you may need to give it a prod.

```plaintext
My @Codebase is updated. Based on our discussion so far, immediately start executing the first step in the plan we've outlined. Focus on implementing the changes, such as refining the repository structure, cleaning up dead or duplicate code, and improving documentation. As you proceed, update our ROADMAP.md file to reflect progress and ensure everything stays on track. Provide updates as you complete each step, ensuring alignment with our priorities. Only stop to discuss if you encounter an issue that requires clarification or decision-making.

# srt-model-quantizing

srt-model-quantizing is a pipeline for downloading models from Hugging Face, quantizing them, and then uploading them to a Hugging Face-compatible repository. This project is developed by SolidRusT Networks and supports two quantization methods: Exllama2 and AutoAWQ.

## Features

- Supports both Exllama2 and AutoAWQ quantization methods
- Designed for simplicity and ease of use
- Attempts to support both Nvidia CUDA and AMD ROCm GPUs
- Intended for use on Linux servers

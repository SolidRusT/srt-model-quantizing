# Development Notes

## Start a new cycle

```plaintext
Let's begin the next development cycle for our quantization pipeline app. Review the current state of the project and cross-reference it with any existing documentation or pending tasks. Identify any new models, features, or updates from Hugging Face that should be supported, and check if our quantization methods (Exllama2 and AutoAWQ) are still up-to-date. Propose a prioritized list of actions or improvements for this cycle, ensuring that all changes maintain the app's simplicity and user-friendly nature. If there are any updates needed in the documentation or README.md file, highlight those as well.
```

## Let's Proceed

```plaintext
Based on our discussion so far, immediately start executing the first step in the plan we've outlined. Focus on implementing the changes while maintaining the app's simplicity and user-friendly design. Provide updates as you complete each step, ensuring that the process aligns with our objectives. Only stop to discuss if you encounter an issue that requires clarification or decision-making. Let's make tangible progress towards enhancing the app's functionality and usability.
